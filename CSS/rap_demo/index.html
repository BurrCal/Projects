            <h2>Origin Of Rap</h2>
            <p>Rap as a genre began at block parties in New York City in the early 1970s, when DJs began isolating
                the
                percussion breaks of funk, soul, and disco songs and extending them. MCs tasked with introducing the
                DJs
                and
                keeping the crowd energized would talk between songs, joking and generally interacting with the
                audience.
                Over
                time, it became common for the MCs (or rappers, as they soon became known) to talk and rhyme over
                and in
                sync
                with the music. Initially dismissed as a fad, rap music proved its commercial viability in 1979 with
                the
                release
                of The Sugarhill Gang's
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcCK99wHrk0&ab_channel=SugarhillRecords">Rapper's
                    Delight</a>,
                and then again in 1980 with Kurtis Blow's
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZDUEilS5M4&ab_channel=rekoj1376">The Breaks</a>,
                a Top 5 hit that eventually went gold.
            </p>
            <p>The respective disciplines of rapping and DJing continued to evolve, leading to the mid-'80s era
                known as
                the
                golden age of hip-hop, in which artists like Run DMC and Rakim pushed the boundaries of the art form
                and
                helped
                to make rap into the ubiquitous mainstream entity that it is today.</p>

            <h2>The Golden Age</h2>
            <p>Hip-hop’s “golden age” is a name given to a period in mainstream hip-hop, usually cited as being a
                period
                varying
                in time frames during the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s, said to be characterized by its diversity,
                quality,
                innovation and influence. There were various types of subject matter, while the music was
                experimental
                and
                the
                sampling eclectic. The artists most often associated with the phrase are Run-D.M.C., Public Enemy,
                Beastie
                Boys,
                Boogie Down Productions, Eric B. & Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, De La Soul, Gang Starr, A Tribe Called
                Quest,
                the
                Jungle Brothers, and more.</p>
            <p>Along with focusing on black nationalism, hip-hop artists often talked about urban poverty. This
                brought
                a
                great
                deal of listeners to the genre who were struggling with poverty and were coping with the scourge of
                alcohol,
                drugs, and gangs in their communities. Public Enemy’s most influential song came out at the time of
                urban
                poverty called “Fight the Power.” The song speaks up to the government proclaiming that people in
                the
                ghetto
                have the freedom of speech and rights like every other American.</p>
