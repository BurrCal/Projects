    <p><b>Ice hockey</b>(or simply <b>hockey</b>) is a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_sport">team sport</a>
        played on ice skates,usually on an ice skating rink with lines and markings specific to
        the sport. It belongs to a family of sports called hockey. In ice hockey, two opposing teams use
        ice hockey sticks to control, advance and shoot a closed, vulcanized, rubber disc called
        a "puck" into the other team's goal. Each goal is worth one point. The team which scores
        the most goals is declared the winner. In a formal game, each team has six skaters on the
        ice at a time, barring any penalties, one of whom is the goaltender. Ice hockey is a full
        contact sport.
